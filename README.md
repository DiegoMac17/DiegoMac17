## Hi there 👋


- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - SPARROW: A modular Biomedical LLM Agent framework for clinical reasoning (aka. diagnosis) and biomarker target prediction
  - Quest2Dx: transformer-based screening for Parkinson’s using patient questionnaires

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - Scalable multi-node LLM training with DeepSpeed and Hugging Face Accelerate
  - Reinforcement learning fine-tuning (GRPO) for biomedical language models
  - How to develop biomedical applications (software dev)

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - Multimodal AI projects in precision medicine or neurodegenerative disease
  - Explainable AI pipelines for clinical decision support
  - Developing open-source tools for Biomedical LLMs and agentic workflows

- 🤝 Collaborations & Mentorship
  - I’m always excited to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects at the intersection of AI, healthcare, and biomedicine. If you’re working on:
    - Early disease detection using multimodal data  
    - Explainable AI for clinical decision support  
    - Biomedical LLM development & fine-tuning strategies  
    - Ontology-driven workflows for knowledge integration
  - …please reach out! I enjoy mentoring junior researchers and talking about research and life!
